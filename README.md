# mitempmqtt
Get temperature and humidity from Xiaomi Mijia flashed with https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer and send them to a private MQTT server (via ssh tunnel)

The idea is to use the advertised data in Home Assistant

What it uses
--
- MiTemperature2 / ATC Thermometer version 5.0 https://github.com/JsBergbau/MiTemperature2#readme in **mitemperature** container that colects data from `mitemperature/sensors.ini` and sends it to a MQTT server
- ssh *(will be changed to autossh)* using supervisor in portforward to create a portforward for the MQTT broker
- bluetooth

What you need to set in .env
--
- The **GATEWAY** to the MQTT broker. **eg: "root@192.168.68.64 -p 2220"** if you want to create a ssh tunnel to that ip address. MAKE SURE YOUR HOST ~/.ssh/id_rsa is allowed to connect to that host OR you can use **GATEWAY=off** if the MQTT broker is running locally
- **PORTFORWARD** is the actual link that needs to be created. If you don't want to edit `mitemperature/mqtt.conf` you need to forward this to port `1883`. **eg: "PORTFORWARD=1883:localhost:1883"**

Tested on
--
- Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) 64 bits
- Raspberry PI4 - Raspian OS Lite 32 bits

How to use in Home Assistant
--
- Install an MQTT broker *(or add to this container, I may add a version here too using mosquitto broker https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto )* 
- Add MQTT Integration
- Setup sensors

Example of sensors.yaml
--
```
- platform: mqtt
  name: "Bedroom Temperature"
  state_topic: "mitemp/bedroom"
  unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
  value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"
- platform: mqtt
  name: "Bedroom Humidity"
  icon: "mdi:water-percent"
  state_topic: "mitemp/bedroom"
  unit_of_measurement: "%"
  value_template: "{{ value_json.humidity }}"
```
^^^ PS: By far not ideal. I will create an integration that would auto discover anything published to the MQTT that has temperature/humidity/battery_voltage in the MQTT broker
